# PRD Generation Guide

## Purpose

Create detailed Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) that junior developers can easily understand and implement.

## Process

1. **Receive request** - User describes a feature
2. **Ask questions** - Gather details using numbered/lettered options for easy response
3. **Generate PRD** - Create document based on answers
4. **Save as** - `/tasks/prd-[feature-name].md`

## Key Questions to Ask

-   **Problem:** What problem does this solve?
-   **Users:** Who will use this?
-   **Features:** What should users be able to do?
-   **User stories:** "As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"
-   **Success criteria:** How do we know it works?
-   **Out of scope:** What should this NOT do?
-   **Data needs:** What information is required?
-   **Design:** Any UI guidelines or mockups?
-   **Edge cases:** What could go wrong?

## PRD Template

1. **Overview** - Feature description and problem it solves
2. **Goals** - Specific, measurable objectives
3. **User Stories** - How users will interact with the feature
4. **Requirements** - Numbered list of what the feature must do
5. **Non-Goals** - What's explicitly out of scope
6. **Design Notes** - UI/UX requirements (if applicable)
7. **Technical Notes** - Known constraints or dependencies (if applicable)
8. **Success Metrics** - How to measure effectiveness
9. **Open Questions** - Unresolved items

## Remember

-   Write for junior developers
-   Avoid jargon
-   Be Explicit
-   Ask clarifying questions before writing
-   Don't implement - just document
-   Focus on "what" and "why", not "how"
