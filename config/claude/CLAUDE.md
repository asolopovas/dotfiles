## CRITICAL RULES

- Prioritize simplicity and clarity over complexity
- Research popular third-party libraries for solutions prior writing custom code
- Always Oprimize Code Performance
- No comments in the code
- Use CUDA device where possible its 100% available and WSL-compatible
- Never use hard coded values if needed use constants or configs


## TOOLS

- **always use** fd over find
- **always use** rg over grep
